# Explanation of the `computeAreas` Function

This document explains the functionality of the `computeAreas` function, 
including its components, calculations, and outputs.

---

## 1. Unsigned Area

The **unsigned area** is always computed as the square root of the integral 
of squared differences across the full range of \\( x \\) (latent trait).

**Formula**:
\\[
\\text{Unsigned Area} = \\sqrt{\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\big( (a_1 - a_2) + (b_1 - b_2)x \\big)^2 \\phi(x; \\mu, \\sigma) \\, dx}
\\]

---

## 2. Signed Area

If the slopes differ (\\( b_1 \\neq b_2 \\)), the **signed area** is computed by 
calculating the Euclidean distances (unsigned areas) above and below the crossover 
point \\( x_c \\), and subtracting them.

**Formula**:
\\[
\\text{Signed Area} = \\sqrt{\\int_{x_c}^\\infty \\big( (a_1 - a_2) + (b_1 - b_2)x \\big)^2 \\phi(x; \\mu, \\sigma) \\, dx} - \\sqrt{\\int_{-\\infty}^{x_c} \\big( (a_1 - a_2) + (b_1 - b_2)x \\big)^2 \\phi(x; \\mu, \\sigma) \\, dx}
\\]

Where:
- \\( x_c = \\frac{a_2 - a_1}{b_1 - b_2} \\): The crossover point between the two curves.
- \\( \\phi(x; \\mu, \\sigma) \\): The probability density function of the latent trait, defined as:
  \\[
  \\phi(x; \\mu, \\sigma) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi} \\sigma} e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}
  \\]

---

## 3. Standardized Areas

If the pooled standard deviation \\( sd \\) is supplied, the function computes standardized versions of both unsigned and signed areas.

**Formulas**:
\\[
\\text{Standardized Unsigned Area} = \\frac{\\text{Unsigned Area}}{sd}
\\]

\\[
\\text{Standardized Signed Area} = \\frac{\\text{Signed Area}}{sd}
\\]

---

## 4. Standard Errors

If a covariance matrix is supplied, the function uses the **Delta Method** to compute the standard errors of the unsigned and signed areas.

**Gradients**:
- The gradient for the unsigned area is computed with respect to the parameters \\( a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2 \\).
- If the slopes differ, the gradient for the signed area is also computed.

**Standard Errors**:
\\[
\\text{SE(Unsigned Area)} = \\sqrt{ \\nabla_{\\text{Unsigned Area}}^T \\Sigma \\nabla_{\\text{Unsigned Area}} }
\\]

\\[
\\text{SE(Signed Area)} = \\sqrt{ \\nabla_{\\text{Signed Area}}^T \\Sigma \\nabla_{\\text{Signed Area}} }
\\]

---

## Outputs

The function returns a list with the following components:
1. `unsigned_area`: Raw unsigned area.
2. `signed_area`: Raw signed area (if slopes differ; otherwise `NA`).
3. `std_unsigned_area`: Standardized unsigned area (if pooled SD is supplied).
4. `std_signed_area`: Standardized signed area (if slopes differ and pooled SD is supplied).
5. `unsigned_se`: Standard error of the unsigned area (if covariance matrix is supplied).
6. `signed_se`: Standard error of the signed area (if slopes differ and covariance matrix is supplied).
7. `std_unsigned_se`: Standard error of the standardized unsigned area.
8. `std_signed_se`: Standard error of the standardized signed area.

---

## Summary

The `computeAreas` function unifies the calculation of unsigned and signed areas, their standardized counterparts, and their standard errors. It gracefully handles:
- Parallel lines (no crossover point),
- Missing pooled standard deviation,
- Missing covariance matrix.

This flexibility makes it suitable for a variety of measurement invariance or DIF applications.
